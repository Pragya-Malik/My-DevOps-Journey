# 90-DAYS DEVOPS JOURNEY:-

## Current Level:
 I am an MCA student and a fresher, and I am a beginner in the Cloud and DevOps domain.

## My Understanding of DevOps and Cloud:
 DevOps is used to make the whole deployment thing faster compared to traditional methods. Earlier, there was a separate and lengthy process,
 but DevOps used tools and automation to speed up the deployment.
 Cloud provides different types of services over the internet on a pay-as-you-go model.

## Why I Want to Learn DevOps and Cloud:
 DevOps and Cloud have high job demand and strong future career opportunities. I want to build a stable and high-growth career in this domain.
