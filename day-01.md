# DAY-01 - LINUX REVISION + HANDS-ON PRACTICE + PYTHON BASICS

## DATE:
 2nd FEB, 2026

## GOAL OF THE DAY:
-Revise Linux fundamentals with hands-on practice

-Practice core Linux commands, such as:
1. File Management
2. User & Group Management
3. Package Management
4. Process Management
5. Service Management
6. File Permissions
7. Networking Commands
8. Log Management
9. File Transfer Commands

-Start Python basics for DevOps

## RESULT / OUTPUT OF THE DAY:
 Today I revised Linux while performing hands-on practice on commands. Below are the areas and commands I practiced along with their purpose.
 -> Started Python specifically for the DevOps journey and understood how Python can be used for automation.

1. FILE MANAGEMENT:
-mkdir  ->  Create directories
-touch  ->  Create files
-cp  ->  Copy files
-mv  ->  Move/rename files
-rm, rm -r  ->  Remove files and directories
-ls, ls -l, ls -la  ->  List files and permissions
-pwd  ->  Show current directory

-vim *filename*  ->  Open file in editor
Insert Mode: i
Save & Exit: :wq
Exit without saving: :q!
-> Used vim to create and edit files.

2. USER & GROUP MANAGEMENT:
-useradd  ->  Create user
-passwd  ->  Set password
-usermod  ->  Modify user 
-groups  ->  Show user groups
-whoami  ->  Show current user

3. FILE PERMISSIONS:
-chown  ->  Change file owner
-chgrp  ->  Change file group

4. PACKAGE MANAGEMENT: (APT - Ubuntu)
-apt update  ->  Update package list
-apt upgrade  ->  Upgrade packages
-apt install *package_name*
-apt remove *package_name*
-man apt  ->  View APT manual

5. PROCESS MANAGEMENT:
-ps  -> View running processes
-top / htop  ->  Monitor system
-kill *PID*  ->  Stop process

6. SERVICE & LOG MANAGEMENT:
-systemctl
-journalctl

7. SSH (Secure Shell):
-ssh *user@server_ip*   -> Connect to server
-ssh-keygen  ->  Generate key pair

8. NETWORK COMMANDS:
-ping  -> Test connectivity
-traceroute  ->  Show network path
-nslookup  ->  DNS lookup
-curl  ->  Test APIs / URLs
-ifconfig  ->  Network interfaces 

9. FILE TRANSFER COMMANDS:
-scp  ->  Secure copy between systems
-rsync  ->  Sync files efficiently

# python basics :
- Checked Python version using:
  python3 --version
  
- Wrote the first simple print statement:
  print("Hello DevOps")
  
-Learned about variables

-Learned conditional statements:
1. if
2. elif
3. else

-Learned loops:
1. for loop
2. while loop

-Learned about functions:
1. Creating functions using def
2. Calling functions

-Learned about Python libraries (modules):
1. What is a library
2. How to import libraries, like:
   import os


## WHAT I GAINED TODAY? 
- Strong revision of Linux fundamentals
- Confidence in core administration commands
- Better understanding of services, logs, permissions, and SSH
- Started Python journey for DevOps
