## GOALS: 
 - Understand what major DevOps tools do and why they exist
 - Learn where each tool fits in a project
 - Learned about NGINX and Networking concepts and where they are used in DevOps
 - Strengthen real-world Linux usage by practicing hand-on
 - Solving Linux scenario-based questions
 - Start shell scripting



## OUTPUT / RESULT:

-> DEVOPS MAJOR TOOLS UNDERSTANDING:

 - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) — Why automation of infrastructure matters
 - CI/CD — Meaning, purpose, and real-world usage
 - Containerization — Why Docker exists
 - Orchestration — Why Kubernetes is used
 - Configuration Management — Purpose and tools
 - Cloud Platforms — Why modern apps run on the cloud
 - Monitoring & Logging — Importance in production systems
 - DevOps Lifecycle Flow — How real projects move from code → production

 *During these learning days, I focused on building strong conceptual clarity about the DevOps ecosystem. I understood how different tools are not random technologies but part of a structured lifecycle. I learned why Infrastructure as Code is important for DevOps, why CI/CD is critical for faster and safer software delivery, and why containerization helps ensure consistent environments across different platforms.*

 *I studied orchestration concepts and learned why Kubernetes is required when applications scale across multiple containers and servers. I also explored configuration management tools and understood how they help maintain consistent system configurations.*

 *I gained clarity on why cloud platforms are central to modern DevOps practices, including scalability, cost optimization, and global availability. I also learned the importance of monitoring and logging in production systems, especially for detecting failures early and maintaining system reliability.*


-> NGINX + NETWORKING AND THEIR USAGES IN DEVOPS:

 - Nginx concept and role in DevOps
 - Proxy / Reverse Proxy basics
 - IP Address, Ports, DNS
 - HTTP request flow basics
 - Application port testing basics

I studied Nginx conceptually and understood its role as a web server and reverse proxy. I also strengthened networking fundamentals like IP addressing, ports, DNS resolution, and HTTP request flow.*


-> LINUX:

 - Linux CLI mastery
 - Scenario-based LINUX questions (40–50 min daily practice)
 - Linux Networking commands and usage
 - Storage Concepts — Mounting, LVM, Disk Attachment
 - Log reading and system diagnosis

   *On the Linux side, I deepened my command-line knowledge and started solving scenario-based troubleshooting questions daily. This helped me understand system behavior instead of just memorizing commands. I studied networking commands in Linux and understood how systems communicate internally and externally.
   I also explored storage concepts like LVM, mounting, and disk attachment, which helped me understand how storage is managed dynamically in servers.*


-> SHELL SCRIPTING + PYTHON FOR DEVOPS:

 - Shell scripting basics (variables, read, echo, conditionals)
 - Automation scripts (package installer, file checks)
 - Python for DevOps fundamentals
 - API basics using Python

  *In scripting, I started writing shell scripts using variables, user input, conditionals, and automation scripts like package installers. I also continued learning Python and began to understand how it interacts with APIs, which is important for automation and cloud integrations in DevOps.*



## KEY LEARNING:

 - DevOps is not about tools; it is about system automation and reliability thinking
 - Linux troubleshooting thinking is more important than command memorization
 - Automation mindset is essential for DevOps growth
 - Networking basics are mandatory for understanding cloud and production systems
 - Monitoring and logging are critical for real production environments
 - Scripting is the foundation for infrastructure automation
 - Understanding traffic flow (DNS → Proxy → App → Response) is important for real-world debugging
