## PYTHON BASICS TO ADVANCED (HANDS-ON PRACTICE)

# DATE: 04TH FEB, 2026

## GOAL OF THE DAY:
-Strengthen Python fundamentals for DevOps
-Practice Python basics (variables, loops, conditionals, functions)
-Work with Python data structures (mainly List & Dictionary)
-Do hands-on practice using data structures
-Start understanding how Python is used in DevOps
-Learn the basics of working with APIs using Python

## RESULT / OUTPUT OF THE DAY:
Today, I focused mainly on Python and moved from revising basics to exploring how Python is practically used in DevOps scenarios.

-> Python Fundamentals (Revised):

1. Practiced: [ *Strengthened understanding of Python core syntax.*]
  - Variables and data types
  - Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
  - Loops (for, while)
  - Functions (def, parameters, return)

2. Wrote small programs using:
  - Conditions inside loops
  - Functions with inputs and outputs
 

-> Python Data Structures (Hands-on): [*Understood how lists and dictionaries are widely used in automation scripts.*]

 *Learned and practiced:*
  - List
  - Dictionary
  - Tuple
  - Set

 *Main focus on:* 
1. List:
  - Creating lists
  - Accessing elements
  - Adding and removing items
  - Looping through lists
2. Dictionary:
  - Creating key-value pairs
  - Accessing values using keys
  - Adding and updating keys
  - Looping through a dictionary


-> Working with APIs (Introduction):

1. Learned what an API is
2. Understood how applications communicate using APIs
3. Learned concept of:
  - Request
  - Response
  - JSON data
4. Basic understanding of using Python to call APIs and process responses.


## WHAT I LEARNED TODAY:
 - Python basics are the foundation for automation
 - Lists and dictionaries are extremely important in DevOps scripts
 - Python can interact with external services using APIs
 - DevOps engineers use Python heavily for automation and tooling
